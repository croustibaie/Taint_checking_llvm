implement missing detection functionality
 - operators + - * / % ++ --   CHECK
 - logic operators && || !  CHECK
 - bitwise ops & | ^ ~ << >>
 - eq operators < <= == != > >= CHECK
   +++ YEEAAHH.. there's that thing that a == might be translated to a x86 sub or to a x86 cmp
       Both behave identically except that one shows up as Cmp in the taintgrind log and the other
       as evil Sub.. we somehow have to work around this   CHECK
 - taint ending up in syscall
 - taint ending up in conditions CHECK
 - null ptr comparisons (there is already one test in instr_cop) CHECK
 - malloc, etc.

scale
 - test with multiple files as input
 - test with shared libs

evaluate
 - tinyhttpd
 - nginx
 - apache
